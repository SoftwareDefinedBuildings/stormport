/*
 * Determine a reasonable value for maxseg size.
 * If the route is known, check route for mtu.
 * If none, use an mss that can be handled on the outgoing interface
 * without forcing IP to fragment.  If no route is found, route has no mtu,
 * or the destination isn't local, use a default, hopefully conservative
 * size (usually 512 or the default IP max size, but no more than the mtu
 * of the interface), as we can't discover anything about intervening
 * gateways or networks.  We also initialize the congestion/slow start
 * window to be a single segment if the destination isn't local.
 * While looking at the routing entry, we also initialize other path-dependent
 * parameters from pre-set or cached values in the routing entry.
 *
 * Also take into account the space needed for options that we
 * send regularly.  Make maxseg shorter by that amount to assure
 * that we can send maxseg amount of data even when the options
 * are present.  Store the upper limit of the length of options plus
 * data in maxopd.
 *
 * NOTE that this routine is only called when we process an incoming
 * segment, or an ICMP need fragmentation datagram. Outgoing SYN/ACK MSS
 * settings are handled in tcp_mssopt().
